Tridactyl has to override your new tab page due to WebExtension limitations. You can learn how to change it at the bottom of the page, otherwise please read on for some tips and tricks.

-   You can view the main help page by typing [`:help`][help], and access the tutorial with [`:tutor`][tutor]. There's a [wiki](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/wiki) too - feel free to add to it. You may find `:apropos` useful for finding relevant settings and commands.

-   You can view your current configuration with `:viewconfig`.

-   Tridactyl funding ðŸ‘€: [donate via GitHub sponsors here](https://github.com/users/bovine3dom/sponsorship). All GitHub and Patreon donors get a nice little newsletter once every few months; people who donate at least 10USD a month get a "tips & tricks" newsletter roughly once a month ([see an example here](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/blob/master/doc/newsletters/tips-and-tricks/1-hint-css-selectors.md)). You can also donate via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=7JQHV4N2YZCTY), but they charge fairly high fees and you won't get any newsletters. Donations currently go towards ensuring that bovine3dom can afford to work one day a week on Tridactyl. Previously the donations have funded an in-person developer retreat.

*   If Tridactyl breaks a website or is broken by a website, trying the steps in the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/blob/master/doc/troubleshooting.md) might help.

*   You can contact the developers, other users and contributors for support or whatever on [Matrix][matrix-link], [Gitter][gitter-link], [Discord][discord-link] or [IRC][libera-link].

*   If you're enjoying Tridactyl (or not), please leave a review on [addons.mozilla.org][amo].

## Highlighted features:

-   `f`/`F` â€” enter the "hint mode" to select a link to follow. `F` to open it in a background tab. (Note: hint characters should be typed in lowercase.)
-   `Shift` + `Insert` or `Ctrl-Alt-Escape` â€” enter "ignore mode" to send all key presses to the web page you are on. Press `Shift` + `Insert` or `Ctrl-Alt-Escape` again to return to the highly productive "normal mode".
-   `H`/`L` â€” go back/forward in the history.
-   `o`/`O` â€” open a URL in this tab (`O` to pre-load current URL).
-   `t`/`T` â€” open a URL in a new tab (`T` to pre-load current URL).
-   `gt`/`gT` â€” go to the next/previous tab.
-   `d` â€” close the current tab.
-   `<C-,>` â€” "escape hatch": get to a place where you can use Tridactyl. Works anywhere in the browser.
-   `/` â€” open the find search box. Use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + g/G to cycle through search results.
-   `b` â€” bring up a list of open tabs in the current window.
-   `s` â€” if you want to search for something that looks like a domain name or URL.
-   `gi` â€” scroll to and focus the last-used input on the page.
-   `gr` â€” open Firefox reader mode (note: Tridactyl will not work in this mode).
-   Bind your own commands with, e.g., `:bind J tabprev`. Type `:help bind` to see help on custom binds.
-   `yy` â€” copy the current page URL to your clipboard.
-   `[[`/`]]` â€” navigate forward/backward though paginated pages.
-   `ZZ` â€” close all tabs and windows, but it will only "save" them if your about:preferences are set to "show your tabs and windows from last time".
-   `<C-v>` â€“ send a single keystroke to the current website, bypassing bindings by entering ignore mode temporarily
-   `<C-o>` â€“ run a single normal mode binding when in ignore mode
-   [`:help hint`][help-hint] to see all the other useful hint modes (this is the `f` magic. :) ).
-   `:help <keybinding>` to learn more about what a specific key binding does.
-   `:colours [dark|quake|...]` to change Tridactyl's theme (and the colour of this page)
-   `:set keyboardlayoutforce true` to pretend that your keyboard layout is always QWERTY - very useful for, e.g., Cyrillic keyboards

## Important limitations due to WebExtensions

-   You can only navigate to most about: and file: pages if you have Tridactyl's native executable installed.
-   Firefox will not load Tridactyl on about:\*, some file:\* URIs, view-source:\*, or data:\*. On these pages `Ctrl-Comma` (that's `<C-,>` in Tridactyl-speak) is your escape hatch.
-   You can change the Firefox GUI with `guiset` (e.g. `guiset gui none` and then `restart`) if you have the native messenger installed, or you can do it yourself by changing your userChrome.
-   Tridactyl cannot capture key presses until web pages are loaded. You can use `:reloadall` to reload all tabs to make life more bearable, or flip `browser.sessionstore.restore_tabs_lazily` to false in `about:config`.

## Why do I see this here?

Tridactyl overrides your newtab page because it cannot insert its content script on the default about:newtab. Without the content script, our shortcuts won't work, even if you're just passing through the page. We're working with Firefox on improvements to the WebExtension APIs that will remove this restriction.

### How can I get rid of it?

-   `:set newtab [URL]`
    -   e.g, `:set newtab about:blank`

Also, if you want to use a new tab page provided by another extension, make sure to install said extension after Tridactyl. Uninstalling and re-installing the other extension should work too.

Alternatively, if you don't need Tridactyl to work on the new tab page, you can install the beta build without new tab page. You can get it [here][nonewtablink]. To migrate your configuration across builds, see [this comment][migratelink] or [this issue](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/1353#issuecomment-463094704).
